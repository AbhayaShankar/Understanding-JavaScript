Answer : Yes, Understanding Errors is very important as it will help in the time of debugging the code if in case anything goes wrong.
There are basically 3 Important errors - 
i. referenceError - Accessing a variable even before it has been initialised in case of 'let' and 'const' gives a referenceError.
		- referenceError: cannot access.
		- referenceError: not defined.

ii. syntaxErrors - Redeclaring a let variable will give a SyntaxError.

iii. typeErrors - Declaring a 'const' again even when it is being Initialised will give a typeError.
